# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this webpage is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The table filters include date, city, state, county, and shape.

A user may use this website if they saw a UFO sighting and want to confirm their sightings. They would be able to filter their date, city, state, country, and/or shape. 

### Using the filters
Using lowercase letters, you can filter results for UFO sightings. For example, if I want to see all UFO sightings in CA that had the shape of a triangle, I would set my filters to "ca" and "triangle." I would then press ENTER on my computer keyboard to initiate the filter. The filter can be reset by clicking the phrase "UFO Sightings" at the top left of the page.

## Summary
#### Drawback
When typing in a filter, it must be in lowercase. This can cause for errors when users use the filters. For example, most people will capitalize CA, however, the filter requires the letters to be in lowercase.

### Recommendations
1. The filters could be more flexible. For example, if the user could type different variations of the word "California." If the filter was more flexible and allowed several variations like CA, ca, California, or california, the website would always produce resutls. Having filters that allow more variation makes the website more user-friendly and less frustrating. 

2. The date filter could also be more flexible if it allowed for a date range instead of one date. For example, maybe a user cannot remember the exact date that they spotted a UFO, but they remember the week. Having a date range would allow the website to be more flexible for the user.
